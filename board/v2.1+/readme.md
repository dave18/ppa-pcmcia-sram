This version is a small change to the 2.1 board.  Changes are:

* Allows use of 8mb version of SRAM - Note, this doesn't increases the memory from 4mb as the additional address pin is grounded. It is just for compatibility.
* Board parameters brought in line with PCBWay prototyping parameters to enable cheaper production
* PCMCIA connector moved 0.5mm closer to edge of board to fit with version I found at AliExpress.  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000671140408.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.9.21ef1802yaBDrj
