This version is a small change to the 2.1 board.  Changes are:

Allows use of 8mb version of SRAM - Note, this doesn't increases the memory from 4mb as the additional address pin is grounded. It is just for compatibility.
Board parameters brought in line with PCBWay prototyping parameters to enable cheaper production
